## CS 6161 Final Project
This project explores approximation algorithms for MaxSAT

Algorithms currently implemented:

* Randomized algorithm from Kleinberg-Tardos 13.4
    * This is a very simple but effective algorithm. For CNF formulae
    with $d$ literals in each clause, this algorithm satisfies
    $(1-\frac{1}{2^d})100%$ of clauses on average.

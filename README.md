## An Analysis of the Kleinberg-Tardos Max-SAT Approximation Algorithm
## CS 6161 Final Project

This paper analyzes the extremely simple yet effective Max-SAT approximation
algorithm in Chapter 13.4 of Kleinberg-Tardos.
I have also implemented the algorithm in Haskell (`MaxSAT.hs`), along
with a driver for running experiments. `MaxSAT.hs` outputs the result of
experiments to a csv file, which `stats.py` can then use as input to
return summary statistics for the  experiments.

The paper is here in its original Pandoc Markdown format, but for a version
readable online peruse the Jupter Notebook version (`project-writeup.ipynb`).
